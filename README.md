# Ready Set Boole: Boolean Algebra and Set Theory | 42

Welcome to this hands-on exploration of logic, **boolean algebra**, **set theory**, and much more—all implemented in ***Rust***! Throughout this project, a series of exercises was completed, each enhancing understanding of these foundational mathematical concepts.

The general rules section sets the stage for the journey, establishing the fundamental principles and guidelines applied throughout the exercises.

## Exercise 00 - Adder
The journey started with the basics of boolean algebra. The task was to implement a simple binary adder in Rust. This exercise proved vital in familiarizing with boolean logic operations and understanding how they can be harnessed to perform arithmetic operations.

## Exercise 01 - Multiplier
Building on the concepts from the adder exercise, the next step was to implement a binary multiplier. This reinforced the understanding of binary arithmetic and its pivotal role in computing logic.

## Exercise 02 - Gray code
The introduction to Gray code—a binary numeral system where two successive values differ only in one bit—was an insightful experience. The task involved generating Gray codes, shedding light on the utility of this unique numbering system.

## Exercise 03 - Boolean evaluation
A deeper dive into boolean algebra was taken by creating a Rust function to evaluate boolean expressions. This exercise emphasized the practicality of boolean logic in programming and decision-making processes.

## Exercise 04 - Truth table
The project moved forward with the implementation of a truth table. It proved to be an excellent way to visualize boolean logic and understand the outputs of complex logical expressions.

## Exercise 05 - Negation Normal Form
This exercise challenged the understanding of boolean expressions and their Negation Normal Form (NNF). It was a practical application of rewrite rules and proved useful in enhancing the skill of simplifying and manipulating boolean expressions.

## Exercise 06 - Conjunctive Normal Form
The task at hand was transforming boolean expressions into their Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). Like the previous exercise, it was a hands-on experience that further reinforced the application of boolean algebra rules for simplifying and understanding logical expressions.

## Exercise 07 - SAT
The project ventured into the realm of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) at this stage. The challenge was to implement a SAT solver, leading to a deeper understanding of one of the most fundamental problems in computer science.

## Exercise 08 - Powerset
This exercise involved generating the powerset of a set. Implementing this function helped to better grasp the power and utility of set theory in computer science.

## Exercise 09 - Set evaluation
The task was to evaluate set expressions. Just like boolean evaluation, this task underscored the importance of set operations in programming and data manipulation.

## Exercise 10 - Curve
The tenth exercise required the generation of a space-filling curve. This practical application of the theory discussed in the previous interlude allowed for a deeper understanding of the concept.

## Exercise 11 - Inverse function
The final exercise of the project focused on implementing an inverse function for the space-filling curve from Exercise 10. It wrapped up the series by consolidating the understanding of function inverses, boolean algebra, and set theory.
